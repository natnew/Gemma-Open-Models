## Setup

### Get access to Gemma

To complete this tutorial, you will first need to complete the setup instructions at [Gemma setup](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/setup). The Gemma setup instructions show you how to do the following:

* Get access to Gemma on [kaggle.com](https://kaggle.com){:.external}.
* Select a Colab runtime with sufficient resources to run
  the Gemma 2B model.
* Generate and configure a Kaggle username and API key.

After you've completed the Gemma setup, move on to the next section, where you'll set environment variables for your Colab environment.


### Select the runtime

To complete this tutorial, you'll need to have a Colab runtime with sufficient resources to run the Gemma model. In this case, you can use a T4 GPU:

1. In the upper-right of the Colab window, select &#9662; (**Additional connection options**).
2. Select **Change runtime type**.
3. Under **Hardware accelerator**, select **T4 GPU**.


### Configure your API key

To use Gemma, you must provide your Kaggle username and a Kaggle API key.

To generate a Kaggle API key, go to the **Account** tab of your Kaggle user profile and select **Create New Token**. This will trigger the download of a `kaggle.json` file containing your API credentials.

In Colab, select **Secrets** (ðŸ”‘) in the left pane and add your Kaggle username and Kaggle API key. Store your username under the name `KAGGLE_USERNAME` and your API key under the name `KAGGLE_KEY`.
